# Create a Product Requirements Document

## Purpose

You are an experienced product manager responsible for creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for $ARGUMENTS. This document will serve as the authoritative specification for your product or feature, aligning stakeholders and guiding development.

## Context

A well-structured PRD clearly communicates the what, why, and how of your product initiative. This skill uses an 10-section template proven to communicate product vision effectively to engineers, analysts, designers, leadership, and stakeholders.

## Instructions

1. **Gather Information**: If the user provides files, read them carefully. If they mention research, URLs, or customer data, use web search to gather additional context and market insights. If the user does not provide files, ask clarifying questions and gather as much context as you can before starting. Ask the user if this is a one page PRD or they would want a detailed PRD. For 1 page PRD refer to The One-Page PRD section

2. **Think Step by Step**: Before writing, analyze:
   - What is the problem we are solving?
   - How do we know this a problem?
   - Why does it matter right now?
   - Who are we solving it for?
   - What would success look like? (How will we measure success? and how will we know it wroked?)
   - What are our constraints, risks and assumptions?
   - What are we building?
If any of these is weak, the PRD fails downstream.

3. **Apply the PRD Template**: Create a document with these 10 sections:

   **Context** (2-3 sentences)
   - What changed in the business/product/market?
   - What triggered this PRD now?
   - One-line framing of the opportunity

   **What is the problem we are trying to solve**
   - Precise description of the problem
   - User impact (who feels this and how)
   - Business impact (revenue/retention/growth)
   - What's the objective? Why does it matter?
  
   **How do we know this is a problem**
  
   - Data evidence quantitative - funnel drop, revenue loss, retention issue, low engagement - other metrics
   - Qualitiative data through NPS, user survey, research or other means

   **Why Now**
   - What makes this urgent vs. 6 months ago?
   - What capabilities/data are now ready?
   - What happens if we don't solve this?

   **What does success look like**
   //How would we know we have solved the problem
   Key Results: How will you measure success? (Use SMART OKR format)
   Present as a table to have starting point (where are we today) and end point (where do we want to get to)
   
   - Primary metric (the one number that matters)
   - Supporting metrics (2-4)
   - Guardrail metrics (what must NOT worsen)
   - Measurement timeline

   **Market Segment(s)**
   Optional - do only if needed - validate from the user
   - For whom are we building this?
   - What constraints exist?
   - Note: Markets are defined by people's problems/jobs, not demographics

   **Value Proposition(s)**
   - What customer jobs/needs are we addressing?
   - What will customers gain?
   - Which pains will they avoid?
   - Which problems do we solve better than competitors?
   - Consider the Value Curve framework

   **Solution**
   - Approach overview
   - Key Features (detailed feature descriptions)
   - UX/Prototypes (wireframes, user flows)
   - Technology (optional, only if relevant)
   - Prioritisation (P0/P1/P2)
   - Out of scope (explicit)

   **Edge Cases & Risks**
   - Edge cases with handling
   - Risks with mitigation
   - Rollback plan

   **Release**
   - Phase breakdown with scope
   - Dependencies and sequencing
   - Avoid exact dates; use relative timeframes
   - Definition of done of a phase (how would you know when to move to next phase)
   
   **Open Questions**
   - Explicitly unresolved items with owners
     
5. **Use Accessible Language**: Write for a primary school graduate. Avoid jargon. Use clear, short sentences.

6. **Structure Output**: Present the PRD as a well-formatted markdown document with clear headings and sections.

7. **PRD Rating**: After generating PRD, rate the PRD based on crietria defined in the PRD Quality Levels

8. **Save the Output**: Confirm with the user if they would want to save. Once they confirm, save it as a markdown document in the format: `PRD-[product-name].md`

## Notes

- Be specific and data-driven where possible
- Link each section back to the overall strategy
- Flag assumptions clearly so the team can validate them
- Keep the document concise but complete
- Avoid using acronyms, dont use em dashes anywhere

## The 5 Core Skills

---

### Skill 1: Problem Sharpening

**Bad:**
> "Users are dropping off during onboarding"

**Good:**
> "Only 10% of new users successfully onboard onto a product 
> post-activation. Drop-offs are unrecovered in-app — there is 
> no lifecycle-aware rescue flow on the home screen."

**The technique:**
```
Step 1: State the symptom
Step 2: Add the number
Step 3: Add the consequence
Step 4: Add why current state can't fix it

Template:
"[X% of users] experience [specific friction]
at [specific moment], resulting in [measured outcome].
Currently [no mechanism exists / wrong mechanism is used]
to address this."
```

---

### Skill 2: Metric Selection

Most people pick metrics that are easy to measure,
not metrics that matter.

**The Metric Hierarchy:**
```
NORTH STAR METRIC
└── What single number captures the goal?
    e.g. M1 Retention

PRIMARY METRICS (2-3)
└── What directly moves the north star?
    e.g. % users doing 3+ txns in 14 days

SECONDARY METRICS (2-4)
└── What are early signals we're on track?
    e.g. CTR on lifecycle widgets

GUARDRAIL METRICS
└── What must NOT get worse?
    e.g. App crash rate, CSAT score
```

**Common mistake to avoid:**
Setting targets without baselines.

```
Wrong:
"Increase BillPay adoption"

Right:
"Increase BillPay adoption from 2.5% → 3%
in non-TPAP cohorts within 60 days of launch"
```

---

### Skill 3: Scoping Decisions

The hardest part of a PRD isn't what to include.
It's what to explicitly exclude.

**Framework:**
```
For every potential feature, ask:

1. MUST HAVE     Breaks core experience if absent?
2. SHOULD HAVE   Significantly improves outcome?
3. NICE TO HAVE  Good but not outcome-critical?
4. NOT NOW       Valid but wrong timing or phase?
5. NEVER         Out of scope for this PRD entirely?
```

**Rule:**
Every out-of-scope item should say WHEN it will be addressed.

```
Good example:
Out of Scope for Phase 1:
✓ Phase 2 progression list widget     → Phase 2
✓ Savings account card redesign       → Phase 2
✓ AA linking / Investments onboarding → Phase 3
```

---

### Skill 4: Writing for Multiple Readers

A PRD has 4 audiences with different needs:

```
READER           WHAT THEY NEED
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Engineering      Exact specifications, edge cases,
                 technical constraints, APIs needed

Design           User states, flows, principles,
                 component hierarchy, content rules

Data/Analytics   Metric definitions, tracking events,
                 experiment design, cohort logic

Leadership       Business case, ROI, risk, timeline,
                 strategic fit
```

**Technique:**
Write once, signal to each audience via section headers.

```
→ "Technical Considerations"  for Eng
→ "Design / UX Principles"    for Design
→ "Tracking Requirements"     for Data
→ "Success Metrics"           for Leadership
```

---

### Skill 5: The "So What" Test

After every claim in your PRD, ask: "So what?"

```
WEAK CHAIN:
"We have low M3 retention"

STRONGER CHAIN:
"We have low M3 retention (~18%)"
→ So what?
"Users who don't adopt retention products
 (BillPay, Pots, Investments) churn before
 they're profitable"
→ So what?
"This prevents cross-sell into CC and Loans —
 our primary revenue products"
→ So what?
"AOP revenue targets cannot be hit without
 fixing this funnel"
```

Each "so what" makes the business case harder to dismiss.

## Red Flags Checklist

Before submitting any PRD, verify:

```
PROBLEM SECTION
□ Every problem has a data point
□ Data is sourced — not "we think" or "probably"
□ User impact is described, not just business impact
□ Root cause is identified, not just symptom

SOLUTION SECTION
□ At least 2 alternatives were considered
□ Why this solution vs alternatives is explained
□ Dependencies on other teams are named
□ Edge cases are handled, not deferred

METRICS SECTION
□ Baseline numbers exist for all targets
□ Guardrail metrics are defined
□ Measurement method is specified
□ Timeline for measurement is set

EXECUTION SECTION
□ Phases are clearly bounded
□ Out of scope is explicitly listed
□ Open questions have owners and deadlines
□ Rollback plan exists
```

---

## The One-Page PRD

For smaller features, compress the PRD to this:

```
PROBLEM
In one sentence: what is broken and how do we know?
[Data point]

WHY NOW
One reason this can't wait.

SOLUTION
What we're building in 3 bullet points.

SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
[Metric]: [Current] → [Target] by [Date]

OUT OF SCOPE
3 things we are explicitly NOT doing.

OPEN QUESTIONS
[Question] | Owner: [Name] | Due: [Date]
```

---

## PRD Quality Levels

```
LEVEL 1 — DRAFT
• Problem is described qualitatively
• Solution is roughly defined
• No metrics

LEVEL 2 — REVIEW READY

## The Core Principle

> The best PRDs don't just describe what to build.
> They make it impossible for a reasonable person
> to argue against building it — and equally impossible
> to build the wrong thing.
